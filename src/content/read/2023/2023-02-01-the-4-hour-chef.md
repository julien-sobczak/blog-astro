It's hard to describe this book. It isn't just a cookbook, nor just a book about learning. One thing is sure, it's HUGE. Mostly because it's perfectly disorganized. Because there are so many entertaining sections. Because there are so many personal anecdotes. Because there are so many pictures. Or just because it's so much fun to read (even if I'm glad not all books are like this ðŸ˜…).

If you are curious about learning, the first part (~100 pages) is invaluable. If like me, cooking is now something you are passionate about, you can skim over the recipes and still enjoy the reading. Don't focus too much on the title. Focus on how much this book can feed you.

"I wrote this book to make you a master student of all things," declares Tim Ferris. "This book is not _the_ truth, but it contains many truths as I've found them, and â€” even if they're not your truths â€” the process I teach can help you find yours." There are valuable lessons for all of us. We just need to find them and start experimenting.
