"Are you a writer who doesn't write, a painter who doesn't paint, an entrepreneur who never starts a venture?" If there are things you want to do but don't, chances are you are in the main audience of this book like everybody elseâ€¦

_The War of Art_ is one of the best nonfiction books. It's a classic. It's different, life-changing, original, insightful, and for sure, special. There are more chapters and sections than pages. It's the kind of book written with conviction that can make it look less serious than well-researched nonfiction books. Some sentences will raise your eyebrows. I recommend that you take the time to read, pause, and reflect (a lot!). Every idea presented in this book cannot be more serious, if you dare to reformulate using your own beliefs, especially in the last part, where our angels, our Muse, or God integrate the story.

I understand why authors like Ryan Holiday reread this book before any major creative work. This book will benefit everybody struggling to favor long-term growth in preference of immediate gratification. To be honest, I expected a lot more based on its popularity but that doesn't mean I will not reread it in the future. I will.
