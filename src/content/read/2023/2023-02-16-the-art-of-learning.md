This book is one of the most interesting books about learning. You will discover the path to mastery from the trenches.

The book is mostly written as a memoir, relating the journey of the author to conquer chess and martial art tournaments. Having a basic understanding of these disciplines is preferable to appreciate the content and the subtle lessons. I loved the first part (about chess). I failed to grasp the second one (about the martial art Tai Chi Chuan). The last part puts it all together and is closer to a self-help book.

_The Art of Learning_ is more an entertaining reading than a practical book with clear principles and practices to try. You don't need this book if you just want to learn a new skill. But if you want to engage seriously in a discipline, what you will learn in this book is precious and as unique as the author's experience.
