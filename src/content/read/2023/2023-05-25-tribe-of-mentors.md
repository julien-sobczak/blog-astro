If you loved _Tools of Titans_, you will love even more _Tribe of Mentors_.

For this new book, Tim emailed his mentors the same well-thought questions and half of them take hours or days to write sophisticated answers (about success, happiness, focus, meditation, Stoicm, sports, etc.).

You will find once again more than 100 chapters from a diverse panel of contributors (still mostly American). Unlike _Tools of Titans_ where the notes were edited by Tim Ferris, the answers in this book were written by their authors. There is no organization in this book, "just" a collection of wisdoms, to read and reread.

If learning from your own experience seems a good idea, this book will make it obvious that learning from others' experiences is even more invaluable and indispensable.
