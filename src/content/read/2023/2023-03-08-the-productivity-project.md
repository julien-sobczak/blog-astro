When you study a subject for a decade, when you reject job offers to spend a full year focusing on it—experimenting with crazy ideas like alternating between 20 and 80 hours of work per week or watching 70h of TED talks in a single week—you for sure end up with new insights and valuable lessons to share. This is this book.

The books comprise 25 chapters explaining the 25 most effective (and existing) techniques that the author discovered and experimented with.

If you are looking for a first book on the subject, it's definitely a good one. Regrouping effective techniques in a well-organized volume makes them even more useful. _Atomic Habits_ (which you must read too) is another great example of a book presenting existing knowledge in a way that gives even more meaning to the content.
