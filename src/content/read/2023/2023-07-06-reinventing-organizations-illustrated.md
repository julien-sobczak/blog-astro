_Reinventing Organizations_ is one of the most cited management books. The original version is 300-page long, not so long for an eye-opening book, but probably too long as few people read, especially management books. This new illustrated edition introduces the same ideas and is half the size (including the numerous well-designed illustrations) so that you can read it almost in one sitting.

The lessons behind these books emerge from the author's research across mostly 12 organizations. I love how the author chose "normal" companies, not the famous success stories where it's too easy to find reasons why results cannot be replicated. In fact, these "normal" companies are even more impressive. All around the world, people dare to act differently. When you stop seeing organizations as machines that must be optimized but as living systems that are constantly growing, you enter a world of new possibilities. A world where the way to work is more natural, but feels sadly not natural, at first.

The way we worked at the beginning of our career will not be the way we will work when we will retire. Things must change. Things will change. This book has already demonstrated its potential to ignite change. We need more experiences like the ones described in this book. We are at an interesting point in work history. There is so much more to be written on the subject.
