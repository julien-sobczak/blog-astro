If you want to earn more money or want to be happier, starting with this book is a good idea. As outlined by the author, "Two topics impact everyone, whether you are interested in them or not: health and money." This book will benefit everyone (as confirmed by its huge success).

_The Psychology of Money_ challenges brilliantly the preconceived idea that finance is a science, like physics, with rules and laws. The author argues that money is a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know, and where your emotions play a major role.

It's one of my favorite books. It's the kind of book where you end up with a lot more insights than you expected before opening it.

The 20 chapters revolve around the main topic, but exist on their own and could be read independently, even if it's probably simpler to just read it from cover to cover as it's a short book.
