_Make Time_ is like a cookbook. "You wouldn't try all the recipes at once," say the authors, "and you don't need to do all the tactics at once, either." It's a book to find what best works for YOU based on a list of more than 80 tactics to choose from.

The authors spent years at Google as product designers, helping to build services like Gmail, YouTube, and Google Hangouts (= helping to steal our attention). Their reflection on this experience makes this book particularly valuable as they decided to use their unique perspective to design the most invaluable product: how we spend our time.

The authors declare _Make Time_ is not about productivity but all great productivity books focus on the same goal as this book: create more time in your day for the things you care about. I found the book pleasant, and engaging, especially if you are tired of how ineffective you are at work and are ready to make some practical changes in your habits. It's clearly not a definitive book on the subject. Other books like _Four Thousand Weeks_ are more inspiring but less practical but it's a great choice as a first reading on the subject.
