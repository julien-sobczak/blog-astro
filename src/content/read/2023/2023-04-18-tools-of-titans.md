Tim Ferris delivered once again a book like no other one. He spend a month reviewing the notes taken during the interviews of his podcasts (and a few more months editing them). The result is a collection of "tools," including routines, books, common self-talk, supplements, favorite questions, and much more.

The book organization is minimal (to say the least). Three parts (Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise) where wealthy means much more than money and extends to abundance in time, relationships, and so much more. Tim Ferris assigned each personality to one of these parts but subjects are constantly overlapping as all parts are required for a meaningful and happy life. The lack of structure may seem disturbing as you have to process, digest, and organize the information yourself, but the effort is worth it.

The personalities are diverse (authors, athletes, doctors, artists, politicians, etc.) which makes this book even more valuable (but as they are mostly all living in the American culture, the diversity could have been even better). There are so many things to experiment with. If you try them all at once, it would be a disaster. All successful contributors to this book use a few key techniques or processes that make a huge difference for them. You need to find the ones to adapt, to try first, to delay and to ignore. It's the kind of book where you can find something new every time you open it. It's the kind of book you cannot ignore.

Check also _Tribe of Mentors_, by the same author, which I found even more inspiring.
