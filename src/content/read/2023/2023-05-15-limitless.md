Jim Kwik suffered from a head injury when he was a small kid that impaired his focus, concentration, and ability to learn. The “boy with the broken brain” has now become one of the main experts on learning and one of the best examples of human potential, coaching along the way so many celebrities over three decades (just have a look at the long list of praises at the beginning of the book).

What I love about this book is its powerful message. Jim Kwik is a formidable storyteller to challenge all your misconceptions about learning. Don't let a limit in your mindset, motivation, or methods stop you to learn. If you need to be challenged about your ability to learn, you have found the book you need.

I also love how the story of the author perfectly illustrates the magic of books. If books can change us, this one is a great testimony.

What could have been better is the presentation of techniques. The principles behind techniques are not clearly articulated to apply them successfully and techniques are introduced without showing their importance. For example, designing effective flashcards or writing useful notes are key techniques that have a larger impact than some other techniques but that are particularly challenging to put into practice. The book _A Mind for Numbers_ is more practical and preferable if you are interested in techniques. But both books are incomplete. There is always more to learn but once you know you can learn anything, nothing seems impossible.
