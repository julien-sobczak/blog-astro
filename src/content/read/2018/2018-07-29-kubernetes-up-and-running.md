Great technical books all share the same ingredients:

* A good presentation to introduce the technology, its origin and motivations, and most important, why do we need it? (Increase reliability through immutability and self-healing using proven technology)
* A well-defined audience (developers having basic experience with containers and beginning to play with Kubernetes).
* An easy to follow plan (Kubernetes scope is huge but authors succeeded in introducing each subject at the right time without overwhelming the reader with too much concepts or details).
* A good dose of context to explain the solved problems behind each abstraction (Service, Endpoint, ReplicatSet, ConfigMap, ...).
* The right level of details (lot of commands whose syntax are easy to grasp, complemented with the most useful options in practice, and useful comments inside command outputs)
* A hint of humour (the dedication inside the preface sets the tone)
* And perhaps the most important point, an intimate relation with its subject (two of the co-authors cofounded the Kubernetes Project while at Google)

*Kubernetes, Up & Running* is the perfect example of what an introductory book should be. Definitely the best book to get started with Kubernetes. Consider other books only if you already know Kubernetes and want to go deeper on the subject.
