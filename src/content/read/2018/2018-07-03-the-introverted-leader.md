Written by an extroverted consultant, speaker, trainer, coach with an exhaustive career helping thousands of introvert leaders, *The Introvert Leader* condenses an endless experience and countless interviews in a short book, full of practical advices.

*The Introvert Leader* is the introversion guide to the workplace: how to lead people and project, deliver presentations, participate in meeting, network with peers, coach and manage others. The author addresses all of these challenges using her own framework, the 4Ps Process for Preparation, Presence, Push, and Practice. Perhaps a little oversimplistic but help to highlight the different steps required to progress.

Despite its title, the book will benefit a large audience, leaders at any level, including project managers, whether or not they are introvert or have introvert people to lead.

Compared to *Quiet*, this book could not be more different. *The Introvert Leader* is a highly practical book, a collection of guidelines organized around the 4Ps, always illustrated with a short real-life example of just a few lines. As an introvert person that loves to read books, I would have preferred a more developed book. Too many pages never scared me but a book too short often left me on my hunger. So, read *Quiet*, and use *The Introvert Leader* to find ideas to apply in the workspace.
