“A mindshift is a deep change in life that occurs thanks to learning.”

This new book is not as informative as her first book, *A Mind for Numbers*, which was about learning techniques, but is still remarkably written. A succession of richly detailed stories of persons who made professional changes through learning, illustrating what happen when people commit themselves to learning using the techniques of her previous book.

There is a lot to be learned from these diversified stories, and everyone will find ressemblances with his or her own story. Deep changes in life is possible at everything crossroads. There is no single path to follow.

This book is about showing ordinary persons have taken the plunge with success. The good news is prior learning and experiences will prove valuable to learn something even completely different. Learning is key to career selection, career enhancement, and career switching.

With two chapters dedicated to MOOCs, this book aims to help you get the most of online learning. Even if MOOCs are not the only way to learn, since there are more people watching videos than reading books, MOOCs play an important toward a lifelong learning society. The second chapter explains how the author's first MOOC “Learning How to Learn” (the most popular MOOC) was made, a very interesting behind the scene look for the majority of readers, who like me, have follow this memorable course.

Learning does not have to stop in school. Anyone can learn anything at any age. Change IS possible.
