If *Quiet* if the Bible of introversion, *Hiding in the Bathroom* is the story of one of its disciple. A very personal story, full of life anecdotes, mainly based on author's experiences, and enriched by her numerous professional relations.

As a personal book, the content reflects mainly the author's challenges during her professional life: how to land to a job with more flexibility, how to use social networks while preserving a hermit life, how to brand yourself and negotiate, not acting like an extrovert, but using your introversion as a strength to overcome anxiety and succeed in entrepreneurship. The book content often leans on the work side, but never at the expense of the personal life.

Unlike *Quiet* whose content could benefit introvert or extrovert (managers, parents, teachers etc.), *Hiding in the Bathroom* mostly target working introverts, especially women who ambition an entrepreneurship career, but every introvert will be affected by this endearing author.
