We all know by intuition trying to be the best at everything is a bad strategy.
Everything matters equally. Multitasking is the solution. Discipline is the condition. Willpower is a force. A balanced life is the key. Starting small is the way. There. Are. Lies.

What's the ONE Thing you can do such that by doing it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary? By making this question a habit in every moment of your life, you will find your purpose, which will drive your next priority, and makes you truly productive. This simple but powerful idea is at the heart of this book and you will find plenty of evidence to measure how profound this ONE Thing is.

_The ONE Thing_ is one of the most engaging books I've ever read. Great quotes. Profound insights. Simple ideas. Strong argumentation. Effective illustrations. I found the book so much fun to read, and so inspiring. I don’t think this is the only book you need to unlock your potential, but if there is ONE Thing you can do right now, it’s probably to stop reading my review and find a copy of this book.
