I have seen this book quoted so many times and I now understand why. This book is exceptional and will help you learn how to manage difficult conversations (yes, it's something anyone can learn through practice).

The authors found the perfect balance between theory and practice. You will understand why we are so reluctant to engage in difficult conversations, and why we should not, how we and the other person experience the conversation at a profound level, but more important, you will learn practical advices to face the situation, a kind of GPS to navigate the conversation and find the best exit where both will have learn and grow.

This is a book not just for managers. The information distilled in this book is useful, if not indispensable, for any one of us -- friend, parent, colleague, neighbor. Learning difficult conversations is a superpower to navigate life. I don't have that skill for now but reading this book brought me confidence that this is an attainable objective, especially if the other person has read the same book :), so read it!
