_Start with Why_ quickly became a must-read for any serious leader. _Leaders Eat Last_ is equally impactful and insightful, but the challenge for leaders is even bigger than with author's previous book. _Start with Why_ was mainly about inspiring through an actionable vision, a task so many executives have tried with varying degrees of success. _Leaders Eat Last_ unravels the mysteries behind why some teams succeed in overcoming obstacles together when some other teams are doomed to individual and collective failure. The answers will seem counterintuitive to many executives. Simon Sinek discovered great leaders sacrifice their own comfort to put organization needs above theirs, focusing on human relations using trust, integrity, friendship, and empowerment.

The argument really starts with the second part of the book, which I found fascinating. Simon Sinek uses our hormones -- endorphins, dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin -- to help us understand how different we are from other species by our ability (and need) to cooperate and work together. Armed with this background, Simon Sinek continues the development of his argumentation with true stories that range from the military to big businesses. Ideas are maybe not totally new, they are presented in a well-written book, which I recommend to any managers, leaders, executives, or any employee whose motivation is lowering. This is the kind of book that will inspire leaders to act differently, and more importantly, inspire non-leaders to become ones. As the author is saying, “Let us all be the leaders we wish we had.”
