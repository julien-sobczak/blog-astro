Sadly, bad practices in the workspace often spread and stop being challenged. In this book, the co-authors explain their current practices at Basecamp, resulting from two decades of experimentation. And when you experiment, you learn a lot, and you gain interesting insights, which are related in this excellent book.

The scope is very broad -- hiring, office, communication, company vision, stress, vacations, business model, meetings, customer relationship, quality, sleep, productivity, … -- everything tightly packed in a short book, full of great ideas.

The authors focused exclusively on Basecamp, a 50-employee, remote-only software company. That is not the “standard” company and everything described will not apply in every context. You will have to experiment too.

I enjoyed reading the book, from the first to the very last page. My intuition was delighted to hear what I was reading. It was telling me non-stop: “You see, I wasn’t so crazy.” If your job requires to be a minimum creative, I urge you to read this book, and appreciate how others are not afraid to be the exception in a corporate world far from being exceptional.
