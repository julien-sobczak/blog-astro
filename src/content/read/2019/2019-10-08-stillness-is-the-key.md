Stillness: _“To be steady while the world spins around you. To act without frenzy. To hear only what needs to be heard. To possess quietude --exterior and interior-- on command.”_

According to the author, this inner peace is the key to elite performance and to a happy life, today, as in the past. In the same way as meditation captures the essence of Buddhism in a secular way, Ryan Holiday captures the secrets behind stillness, the quest at the heart of Buddhism, Stoicism, Christianity, Hinduism, and other religions or philosophies. Few books have such a large scope.

We find the same recipe used in his previous books -- teachings from the ancient world, combined with extensive modern stories. From Tiger Woods to Winston Churchill, we discover how moving forward by learning to be still help us face a world of distractions and useless conflicts.

I really liked the book, thoroughly researched, well-written, persuasive argumentation, inspiring quotations, pertinent stories, and a profound subject. It’s the kind of book that I will reread for sure.
