Meik Wiking’s books are always a pleasure to read. They are fun, concise, beautifully illustrated, and full of vivid stories to make us consider life under a new light. It’s even truer with this new book. There are a lot of Meik Wiking in this book. A very personal book where the author's sense of humour expresses without restraint to the delight of the reader.

The book only scratches the surface of the subject. Happiness and memories are complex beasts. But you will learn funny facts and better understand which moments to privilege to form happy, lasting memories.
