The book reveals the secrets of great corporations to understand why great performers can't excel in the vast majority of today's corporations, and how we can solve the mismatch.

The authors have worked with senior executives at Sony, Toyota, Google, Ford, but also with cardiovascular surgeons, police officers, high school students, and many other top-level performers. Their work is based on a rich body of research across disciplines ranging from nutrition to cognition; strength training to training strengths; emotional self-regulation to the role of the right hemisphere of the brain; extrinsic to intrinsic motivation. I found nothing really new in this book. The biggest contribution is undoubtedly how it connects these mostly isolated disciplines together. When nutrition, sleep, meditation, napping, physical activity, creativity, brain comprehension, and so much more, are integrated, work finally reveals the full human potential. This is the kind of book that can have a vast impact on a company.

On the negative side, I found the content too dense with a good dose of theory sometimes lost in endless explanations. You will, however, find practical advice on how to restore balance in your life.
