I never hesitate too long before reading Austin Kleon's books. They are short, funny, always inspiring. I know for sure I will fill my quotes reservoir with new memorable ones.

His writing style is very different from other nonfiction books that I read but the format works so well. A great compilation of short, highly-practical, proven guidances. You should not expect too much from this book, but what it delivers, it does it remarkably well!
