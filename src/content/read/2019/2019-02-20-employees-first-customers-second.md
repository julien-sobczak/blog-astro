I worked for a company where new managers were encouraged to read this book. In *Employees First, Customers Second*, Vineet Nayar explains how literally turning conventional management upside down succeeded in placing a major Indian IT service company as one of the fastest-growing and profitable ones in the world, while becomes one of the best workplace in Asia.

The simple idea that the management pyramid can be inverted justifies the reading of this book. You will not find a recipe to follow to reproduce the results. You will not find the answers to most of your questions. Vineet Nayar try to describe, with the most relevant details, his experience as the newly CEO during a period of five years. The book is very short, and thus, barely develop the subject. But you will find the ideas to ignite change. As a proof, the company for which I worked finally reached the first place of *Great Place to Work* ranking in France. This book alone does explain the result but it has invariably contributed to show the right direction to pursue.
