It so common to hear that we, humans, are the bigger threat in security. But before reading this book, I was seriously underestimating how difficult, if not impossible, it is to mitigate social engineering attacks. This book helped me consider how we are “designed” to be an excellent target for attackers. We are eager to trust and cooperate.

As Kevin Mitnick says: “People are not stupid, they are ignorant.” This book will raise your awareness about the most serious threats, so that you will be less likely to be exploited in this way. You will learn definitions of social engineering terminology, and words of wisdom to help strengthen your security strategy, either if you are an individual or a corporation.

Most security books focus on the hardware or software to secure your systems. _The Art of Deception_ is different. This may seem obvious for some, but security is an illusion and even the best training and technologies are not enough. I really became aware of this with this book. I recommend that you add it on your reading list. It’s a captivating book consisting for the most part of eye-opening and educational stories.

Like other Kevin Mitnick’s books, it is co-authored by William L. Simon, a professional writer that turns the greatest teachings present in the head of brilliant human beings into enjoyable books. The book was written fifteen years ago (it’s the first book by Kevin Mitnick), and if technologies have changed, social engineering principles haven’t.
