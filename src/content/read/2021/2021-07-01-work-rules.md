This book was published shortly after the book [_How Google Works_]({% post_url read/2021/2021-05-22-how-google-works %}). Both books talk a lot about Google's culture, but through different perspectives. _Work Rules_ focuses on the HR department, called People Operations at Google, a team led by the author for 10 years.

I found [_How Google Works_]({% post_url read/2021/2021-05-22-how-google-works %}) more insightful and _Work Rules_ more practical. The first is about how a company succeeded using an innovative management approach while the second is about why this approach works and how to make it a reality for you too.

I took more pleasure reading [_How Google Works_]({% post_url read/2021/2021-05-22-how-google-works %}) but it may be because I read it first and there are (logically) many overlapping ideas between the two books. If you are interested in challenging your management practices, both books will be useful but if you must read one, go with _Work Rules_. The book is longer, and provides more context, more references, more arguments that could be useful to persuade others that change must happen for you too.

In this book, the author challenges many received ideas. He demonstrates that what he did at Google can be done elsewhere too. Many ideas cost nothing, except the courage to experiment, and the perseverance to succeed. I don't think it's easy but your people deserve it.
