I always tried to bring some humor at work (my coworkers will probably disagree on that). I love my developer job but my daily tasks are rarely as fun as they could be and spreading joy using humor helps me get through this. Making someone smile is more fulfilling than making code run in those situations.

In reading this book, it becomes obvious that humor fades very quickly as you move up the corporate ladder. I can’t remember the last time I heard my CEO laugh, loudly and naturally. Most leaders sadly believe that gravity and levity are at odds in the workplace. This way of thinking is stupid and based on the extensive researches conducted by the authors, vastly detrimental.

This book was published recently but I have no doubt it will have a huge impact. Humor can be learned like any other skill. And if we consider the time we spend at work, we have plentiful time to practice and perfect this life-changing skill. You will learn in this book why humor at work is a superpower, and how to get started with practical tips. It’s not so hard. Smiling is a good start.

The best books are the ones that feel too short when you reach the last page. This book is way too short... I was hoping for more anecdotes, more stories, more lessons. But above all, I hope that so many more readers will hold a copy of this book. You don’t need a cup of coffee to find the energy to reach your workplace. You need humor, seriously.
