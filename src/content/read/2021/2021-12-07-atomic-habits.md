We are literally what we do every day. Our habits define us and changing who we are always implies changing our habits. Bad habits are easy. You often get immediate pleasure by doing them like eating fast food. Good habits are hard. You receive no burst of dopamine when you decide to eat healthy. But in the long-term, good habits are the ones that really make a difference and make you happier.

If you want to break bad habits and form better ones, you have found the perfect book. _Atomic Habits_ is one of my all-time favorite books. James Clear condenses in the same book all essential techniques, perfectly organized around 4 laws: make the new habit obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying.

The content is not new. Productivity and habits are popular subjects. But how techniques are introduces in the book is remarkable. The book is very well-written and the examples are always practical. It's a book that motivates me to take action. Forming new habits is still hard, but I feel better equipped to endure and make them last.
