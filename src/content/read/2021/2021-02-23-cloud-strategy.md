Every single page of this book can save a lot of money. There are so many reasons for a  cloud migration to go wrong and using your common sense is not a strategy. There is so much hype around cloud computing. A cloud migration is a unique opportunity to change how your company is working and this book is the perfect guide to make it happen.

This book is not just for business leaders. All participants in a cloud migration, including developers, will benefit from the experience of the author. The book is opinionated, which makes the reading very enjoyable. This contrasts with all too common articles on the subject.

Business leaders will find the technical explanations they need to understand the real challenges of a cloud migration. You cannot plan your migration like any business transformation. We are talking about running code in a new environment and you need to keep your feet on the ground if you want to understand for example why the multicloud is definitely not the solution to avoid lock-in. If you want to make informed decisions, you should already be reading the book now.
