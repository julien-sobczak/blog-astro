Beginning with Bash is fairly simple but truly mastering it is a lot more complex. Many subtleties need careful explanation, which is just what *Learning the bash Shell* provides.

Updated to cover the version 3.0 (not the last one currently), *Learning the Bash Shell* still remains the reference to quickly learn the language. This book is designed to address casual Linux users who are just above the raw beginner. Experience with a conventional programming language like C is helpful though not strictly necessary.

At the end of the book, you will know all of the most advanced features of Bash illustrated through a very practical approach, the idioms of the language, and how to write maintenable and debugguable scripts (using a custom debugger whose code is presented). To go further, the book *Classic Shell Scripting* (O'Reilly) could be useful to master the full potential of the command line (awk, pipes, processes).

Well written and very educational, *Learning the Bash Shell* includes also many exercises with detailed solutions to deepen your comprehension of the text. The book is ideal for novice users, showing how to harness the power of bash within a short time.
