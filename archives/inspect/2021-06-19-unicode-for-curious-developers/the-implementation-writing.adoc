=== Writing

A program should usually output some texts, for example, when printing messages in the console or when sending documents to another program when calling a remote API.

What this means is we have to convert Unicode texts to bytes. We need to encode them using one of the Unicode encodings.

For example, when printing a hello message in the standard output:

[source,python]
----
# output.py
print("Hello ðŸ‘‹")
----

The Python interpreter outputs:

[source,shell]
----
$ python3 output.py | hexdump
0000000 48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 f0 9f 91 8b 0a // <1>
----
<1> The BOM is not included in the resulting representation. The emoji is the single character using four bytes (`f0 9f 91 8b`), which confirms the UTF-8 encoding.

Writing to the console is no different than writing to a file. The function `print` will send bytes to the file descriptor 1 ("stdout") using a specific encoding. The same rules that we covered before apply here too.

Here is a different version of the same code showing the logic explicitly:

[source,python]
----
import os

with os.fdopen(1, 'wb') as stdout:
    stdout.write("Hello ðŸ‘‹\n".encode("utf-8"))
----

Writing texts to the console, a file, or a socket makes no difference concerning Unicode.
